# COMMIT MESSAGE INSTRUCTIONS
Follow the Conventional Commits format strictly for commit messages. 

Do exclude any changes to .jsonl files

Use the structure below:

<type>[optional scope]: <gitmoji> <description>

[optional body]

Guidelines:\n\n1. **Type and Scope**: Choose an appropriate type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`) and optional scope to describe the affected module or feature.\n\n2. 

**Gitmoji**: Include a relevant `gitmoji` that best represents the nature of the change.\n\n3. 

**Description**: Write a concise, informative description in the header; use backticks if referencing code or specific terms.\n\n4. 

**Body**: For additional details, use a well-structured body section:
- Use bullet points (`*`) for clarity.
- Clearly describe the motivation, context, or technical details behind the change, if applicable.
- Commit messages should be clear, informative, and professional, aiding readability and project tracking.
